BROOKLYN - PRESENT DAY

*RAINY SOUNDS*
*SAD / DARK VIOLINS*

* BROOKLYN CITYSCAPE*
IT'S BEEN LONG TIME SINCE THE FALL, WHEN IT ALL CAME CRASHING DOWN.
I REMEMBER WHEN BEING A PLUMBER WAS ABOUT JUMPING AROUND AND SAVING WHOLE KINGDOMS.


NOW IT'S JUST A WEARY REMINDER. A REMINDER OF MY HEYDAY - NOW LONG PAST GONE.

PSILOCYBE LASAGNETTIA - THE NAME OF MY ONLY FRIEND.
EVEN THE MUSHROOMS DON'T WORK LIKE THEY USED TO.
INSTEAD OF MAKING ME GROW, THEY JUST MADE ME WEAK.

"BROTHER, YOU CANNOT CONTINUE DO THIS TO YOURSELF"
"OTHERWISE YOU'LL END UP CHASING THE STARS ON RAINBOW ROADS. FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR DAYS"
"YOU HAVE TO STOP"

IT'S BEEN 5 YEARS SINCE HE LEFT.
NOW IT'S JUST ME AND THE PIPES. TWO BROKEN THINGS NEEDING A FIX.
